# rs4094_blockchain_project

This repository contains the code used for creating and deploying the RouletteWheel smart contract on the Computecoin (CCN) blockchain network. 

The contract itself can be found in the `contracts` directory along with a sample that was used for reference. The report created from the results of this work can be found in the `report` directory. For deploying the roulette wheel contract onto the CCN blockchain, a script was created in the `scripts` directory. Tests were written to verify the functionality of the smart contract upon deployment, and that code can be found in the `test` directory. All other files necessary for recreating the environment for this project can be found in the main directory.
